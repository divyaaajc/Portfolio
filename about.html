            <h3>About me</h3>

            <section class="who">
                <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                <p>I am London-based 22-year-old navigating her way through the world of web-development. Growing up, my life consisted of reading and writing 
                    stories and living vicariously though adventures in foreign lands. Coding and the forever evolving industry of technology was never taught 
                    or shown at school, and never seemed to cross my mind as an interest. 
                    <br><br>
                    My coding journey began during the several COVID-19 lockdowns, where I was given the seemingly never-ending gift of time and wanted something 
                    to fill it with. In my desire to create my own blog, and see through the challenges of creating one from scratch rather than a website-creator online,
                    I fell in love with the fun and intricacies that went into the development of my own page. I felt a sense of pride and self-satisfaction creating and 
                    realising my vision on my ownsome. 
                    <br><br>
                    Knowing I had only scratched the surface of this new and fun field, I was confident I wanted to learn and understand more. This led to me teaching 
                    myself front-end development (for now) through Codecademy, and finding a new sense of determination and satisfaction when engaging with different 
                    concepts and languages. By improving and working on my skills everyday, I am excited to learn more and get my foot in the door to this dynamic industry.
