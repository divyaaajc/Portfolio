                        My final project on my first course on Codecademy. This project tied in all of the HTML and CSS I had been learning over the six weeks of self-learning I had undertaken. 
                        At the time, I found it so tricky to measure and place everything where I wanted it, but had so much fun choosing colour themes and making layout decisions to turn this 
                        page into my own. It was here I fell in love with the creativity of coding (In the design of a page, and also the many ways in which you are able to come up with solutions
                        and outcomes to what you want to achieve in your code). </p>

                        This project is the reason I wanted to learn how to create websites in the first place! I adore reading, and always have, and wanted a place to share and 
                        collect all my thoughts. So creating and refining this website is really special to me and I still have so many ideas to implement and explore with this 
                        project. It's kind of like my free-reign of creativity and a way I can show myself what I've learnt as well as adding to things and using google to help further
                        what I want to present. I can't wait to keep on adding and improving this! </p>
